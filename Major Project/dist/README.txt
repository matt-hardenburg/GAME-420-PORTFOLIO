Start by right clicking the .zip folder and then click extract all, extracting the contents to a new folder.

To launch game, double-click the "index.html" file. Alternatively, right click the file and select open.

The assets folder contains all of the images for the project. Don't peek inside if you don't want to be spoiled!

"index.html" must be located in the same folder as the "assets" folder for images to load correctly.

DUE TO ISSUES WITH CSS FORMATTING, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THE GAME WITH THE SIDEBAR STOWED!
Apologies!
